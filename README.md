# Bigdata-Covid19-Analysis
**Description:**</br>
Novel Coronavirus or Covid-19 has created a pandemic leading to a worldwide
shutdown subsequently affecting all sectors.
• This has raised alarms over one of the most overlooked areas to focus: Healthcare
Management.
• With the increase in the number of cases, this tremendously increased the demand
for beds and medical officials to handle the situation but predicting the demand for
the next few months was very tough without the usage of data handling tools.
• This problem can be resolved by selecting precise big data tools to handle the data
and data visualization so that the trend can be analyzed precisely and accordingly the
demand would be satisfied.

**Data Description:**</br>
Attribute Information:</br>
FIPS: US only. Federal Information Processing Standards code that uniquely identifies
counties within the USA.
• Admin2: County name. US only.
• Province_State: Province, state or dependency name.
• Country_Region: Country, region or sovereignty name. The names of locations
included on the Website correspond with the official designations used by the U.S.
Department of State.
• Last Update: MM/DD/YYYY HH:mm:ss (24 hour format, in UTC).
• Lat and Long_: Dot locations on the dashboard. All points (except for Australia)
shown on the map are based on geographic centroids, and are not representative of a
specific address, building or any location at a spatial scale finer than a province/state.
Australian dots are located at the centroid of the largest city in each state.
• Confirmed: Counts include confirmed and probable (where reported).
• Deaths: Counts include confirmed and probable (where reported).
• Recovered: Recovered cases are estimates based on local media reports, and state
and local reporting when available, and therefore may be substantially lower than the
true number. US state-level recovered cases are from COVID Tracking Project.
• Active: Active cases = total cases - total recovered - total deaths.
• Incidence_Rate: Incidence Rate = cases per 100,000 persons.
• Case-Fatality Ratio (%): Case-Fatality Ratio (%) = Number recorded deaths /
Number cases.
• All cases, deaths, and recoveries reported are based on the date of initial report.
Exceptions to this are noted in the "Data Modification" and "Retrospective reporting
of (probable) cases and deaths" subsections below.
